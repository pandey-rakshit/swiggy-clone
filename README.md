# Swiggy-Clone

A Swiggy (clone) website built using ReactJS would have similar features and functionality as the original [`Swiggy`](https://www.swiggy.com) platform. It would allow users to browse and search for their favorite restaurant, food items.

Overall, using ReactJS would allow for a smooth and dynamic user experience on the Swiggy clone website.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:1234) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
